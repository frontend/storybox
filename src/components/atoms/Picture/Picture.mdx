<Title />

## Configuration

In order to provide the most adapted size to each device on each context, we create the following example based on those widths:

<Source language="JSON" code={JSON.stringify(config, undefined, 2)} />

There are 4 classes available to crop the image via css. You can add them next to the `.picture` class:
<Source language="plain" code={`
original         →    .picture-original (keeps the original ratio)
16/9             →    .picture-16x9
5/4              →    .picture-3x2
square (1/1)     →    .picture-1x1
`} />

⚠️ Also don't forget to set the `alt` and `sizes` attributes to make your image accessible and optimized.

## Generating the placeholders

In order to generate the placeholders, we use [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/). You can [install it](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) via homebrew:

<Source language="bash" dark code={`
brew install imagemagick
`} />

Then you can run the following command to generate the placeholders:

<Source language="bash" dark code={`
yarn images:build
`} />

This will take all your `*.jpg` files from `src/assets/placeholders` and generate placeholders inside `public/placeholders`.
